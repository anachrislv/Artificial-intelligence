# **Artificial Intelligence Course - Lab 1 (2023-2024 Spring Semester)**

This repository includes the first lab and theoretical exercises for the **Artificial Intelligence** course in the **2023-2024 Spring Semester**.

## **Authors**
- **Anastasia Christina Liva**

## **Lab Overview**
Lab 1 explores:
- **Exercise 1**: Focuses on state-space representation and search algorithms, implementing techniques like BFS and DFS to solve specific problem scenarios.
- **Exercise 2**: Examines heuristic-based search strategies, utilizing algorithms such as A* to enhance search efficiency and analyze outcomes based on different heuristics.

The **theoretical exercises** complement these practical tasks, analyzing the effectiveness and complexity of AI algorithms.
